# Touple in Python

- Touple are immutable
- These are faster than list but they can not be changed


```python

tup = (21,24,35,56)

#we cannot change the value
# tup[1] = 33

#access element
tup[2]

```


# set in Python

- It does not follow the sequence
- it uses the concept of hash. and it is very fast
- indexing is not supported
- it does not support duplicate valuesP


```python

set = {21,24,35,65,5}

# access s[1] like this can not be done




```
